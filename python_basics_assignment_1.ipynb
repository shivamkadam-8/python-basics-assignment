        "## **2)What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "Ans:-An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code directly, translating it line by line into machine instructions that the computer can execute. Unlike compilers, which translate the entire code into machine language before execution, interpreters process the code at runtime. Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Execution Line by Line: The interpreter reads Python code line by line, translates each line into an intermediate form (often bytecode), and then executes it. This allows for interactive coding and debugging since you can run and test small sections of code independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Interactive Mode: Python interpreters provide an interactive mode, where you can enter and execute code in a command-line interface (CLI). This is useful for testing, learning, and experimenting with code snippets.\n",
        "\n",
        "3)Dynamic Typing: Since Python is dynamically typed, the interpreter handles type checking at runtime. This means you don't need to declare variable types explicitly, making the language more flexible but also potentially slower in execution compared to statically typed languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "4)Portability: Python's interpreter is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This means that Python code written on one platform can run on another without modification, provided the necessary interpreter is installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "5)Standard Python Interpreter (CPython): The default and most widely used Python interpreter is CPython, written in C. It compiles Python code into bytecode and then interprets this bytecode using a virtual machine. CPython is known for its robustness and extensive support for Python libraries."

Keywords are reserved words that have special meanings and functions in the language, and using them as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) would cause a syntax error. This is because the interpreter recognizes these words as having specific purposes and expects them to be used in those contexts."
